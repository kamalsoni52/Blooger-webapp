# Blogging Web Application

Welcome to my Blogging Web Application project! This project demonstrates my skills in Node.js, Express.js, JWT authentication, MongoDB, Tailwind CSS, and various other technologies for building a feature-rich web application.

## Project Overview

This web application allows users to:
- Read blog posts
- Register and authenticate
- Create and publish their own blog posts
- Upload files using Multer
- Secure passwords with hashing and salting
- Perform CRUD operations on user and blog data stored in MongoDB

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- EJS (View Engine)
- JSON Web Tokens (JWT) for authentication
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Multer for file uploads
- MongoDB for data storage

## Project Structure

The project follows the MVC (Model-View-Controller) architecture for organized and maintainable code.

## Usage

This project is meant to showcase my technical skills and is not intended for direct installation or usage. However, you can explore the code and use it as a reference for implementing similar features in your projects.

## License

No license is specified for this project.
